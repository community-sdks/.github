## 🚀 What is Community SDKs?

Community SDKs is an open initiative focused on building high-quality SDKs  
for services that **do not yet have official implementations**  
for certain programming languages.

<br/>

Many APIs exist without proper tooling across ecosystems.  
We fix that.

<br/>

**If an SDK does not exist — we build it.**

## 🏗️ Project Philosophy

✔ Clean architecture  
✔ Typed request & response models  
✔ Explicit error handling  
✔ Consistent naming conventions  
✔ Framework-agnostic core  
✔ Production-ready structure  
✔ Clear documentation  

<br/>

Every SDK is designed to feel native to its ecosystem.

A Go SDK should feel like Go.  
A Rust SDK should feel like Rust.  
A PHP SDK should feel like PHP.

## 🤝 Community Driven

Community maintained.  
Not officially affiliated unless explicitly stated.  
Open for contributions.

<br/>

If an official SDK appears in the future,  
repositories can be transferred or archived appropriately.
